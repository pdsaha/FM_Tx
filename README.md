## ðŸ“¡ FM Transmitter Project

This project involves the design, construction, and testing of a basic FM transmitter circuit as part of the EEE 310 Communication Systems I Laboratory at BUET. The FM transmitter is capable of transmitting audio signals over a short-range radio frequency using frequency modulation techniques. The system is built using discrete components including a condenser microphone, LC oscillator, and power amplifier, and is tested using PSPICE simulations and real-time measurements. Key learning outcomes include practical insights into modulation, circuit layout, and signal quality optimization.
